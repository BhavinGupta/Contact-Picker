# Contact-Picker
Select contact on one click and use that contact for sending mails, etc.

Choose the contact picker with iOS.

I have created here one class that handles everything for you to choose the contact which are available with emails and phone 
numbers and if they are not mentioned with emails and phone numbers than it will be disabled in the picker itself. you can also
change the functionality in that class as per your requirement please take a look for detail understanding on this contact
picker.

There is also functionality of chosing the contact with multiple phone numbers with home, office, work and many more so it 
helps you to select the contact with detail contact info.

Please let me know if this is helpful to you for choosing contact from picker itself.
